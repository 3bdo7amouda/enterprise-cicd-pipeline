## 🔧 Project Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Provisioning

Provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform:

- VPC, Subnets, Gateways, Route Tables
- EKS Cluster (Autoscaling, IAM, Security)
- CI/CD Infrastructure (Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube)
- S3 Buckets, IAM Roles
- Network and infrastructure security

**Deliverables:**
- Fully provisioned AWS infrastructure
- Terraform state management
- Infrastructure diagrams and security report

---

### Phase 2: Environment Configuration

Configure servers and environments using Ansible:

- OS Hardening, SSH Access, Logging
- Docker Installation and Security
- Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube Setup
- SSL, Credential Management, Backups

**Deliverables:**
- All tools and services configured
- Ansible playbooks
- Configuration documentation

---

### Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

Build a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins:

- Jenkins master-agent setup
- Jenkinsfile (Multi-stage pipeline)
- Nexus + SonarQube + Docker integration
- Rollback, testing, automation scripts

**Deliverables:**
- End-to-end pipeline in Jenkins
- Integrated tools
- Pipeline documentation and runbooks

---

### Phase 4: Kubernetes Deployment

Deploy applications using Kubernetes & Helm:

- Namespaces, RBAC, Policies
- Helm Charts (Apps + Services)
- Canary / Blue-Green Deployments
- Pod Security, Secrets, Probes

**Deliverables:**
- Secure Kubernetes cluster
- Reusable Helm charts
- Deployment documentation

---

### Phase 5: Monitoring and Observability

Implement monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana:

- Prometheus (Alert Rules, Retention)
- Grafana (Dashboards, Auth)
- Application metrics, Logging, Tracing
- AlertManager + On-call Setup

**Deliverables:**
- Real-time observability system
- Application dashboards
- Alerting and monitoring documentation

---

## 🔄 Workflow Design

### Development Workflow

- Feature branches + PRs
- Local testing with Docker Compose
- Automated CI (build, test, scan)
- CD to development → staging → production

### Operations Workflow

- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Configuration as Code (Ansible)
- Monitoring + Incident Response
- Scheduled maintenance and patching

## ⏱️ Implementation Timeline

| Week(s) | Task |
|---------|------|
| 1–2     | Infrastructure Provisioning |
| 3–4     | Environment Configuration |
| 5–6     | CI/CD Pipeline Setup |
| 7–8     | Kubernetes Deployment |
| 9–10    | Monitoring and Observability |
| 11–12   | End-to-End Testing & Documentation |

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- **IaC**: Version-controlled, modular Terraform code
- **Security**: Least privilege, regular scans, encrypted secrets
- **CI/CD**: Fast feedback, gated deployments, rollback enabled
- **Monitoring**: Actionable alerts, long-term metrics, tracing

---

## 🔧 Maintenance & Operations

- Regular updates and backups
- Disaster recovery testing
- Automated patching and scaling
- Continuous improvement through retrospectives

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a clear, actionable roadmap for delivering secure and scalable CI/CD pipelines using modern DevOps practices. It empowers teams to innovate quickly while maintaining stability and reliability in production environments.
